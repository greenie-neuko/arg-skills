## TINAG - This Is Not A Game

The foundational principle of ARG design: present the experience as reality, not fiction.

### Core Tenets

**No Fourth Wall**
- Characters never acknowledge being in a game
- Websites are "real" company sites, not game pages
- Documents are "leaked" materials, not prop PDFs
- Never use "level," "score," "player," or game terminology

**Authentic Presentation**
- Corporate sites match real corporate design
- Personal blogs match real blogging platforms
- Documents use appropriate letterhead, formatting
- Audio/video matches expected production quality

**Discoverable, Not Delivered**
- Content exists and is found, not pushed to players
- Trailheads reward observation, not passive consumption
- Solutions require deduction, not instruction following
- Plot reveals through investigation, not exposition

### TINAG Implementation Checklist

| Element | TINAG Compliant | TINAG Violation |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Website | "Harmony Industries - About Us" | "Harmony ARG - Game Hub" |
| Character | Has normal social media presence | "I'm an ARG character" |
| Document | Realistic internal memo format | "PUZZLE #3: Decode this" |
| Community | "Has anyone figured this out?" | "What's the answer to level 2?" |
| Error handling | "Page not found" (normal 404) | "Oops! You haven't unlocked this yet!" |

### Gradations of TINAG

**Strict TINAG**: No acknowledgment, ever
- Best for: Short campaigns, horror ARGs
- Challenge: Hard to maintain, community may feel lost

**Soft TINAG**: In-world only, but winks allowed
- Best for: Most ARGs
- Allow: Trailhead hints from official accounts
- Avoid: Explicit "this is a game" statements

**Post-Game TINAG**: Reveal after conclusion
- Common practice: Behind-the-scenes after finale
- Preserves immersion during play
- Rewards community with peek behind curtain

## Crimes Against Mimesis

Adapted from interactive fiction theory - actions that break the fictional spell.

### The Seven Deadly Crimes

**1. Arbitrary Puzzles**
- Puzzle has no in-world justification
- Solution requires out-of-world knowledge
- Fix: Embed puzzle logic within fiction

```
BAD: "Decode this cipher because it's a puzzle"
GOOD: "The spy encoded his message because he feared interception"
```

**2. Guess-the-Verb Problems**
- Player knows what to do but can't express it
- Solution requires specific phrasing
- Fix: Multiple valid approaches, generous parsing

```
BAD: Only "call the phone number" works
GOOD: Call, dial, ring, phone, contact all work
```

**3. Illogical World Rules**
- In-world logic inconsistent
- Rules change without explanation
- Fix: Establish and follow consistent rules

```
BAD: Cipher works differently in different puzzles
GOOD: Character always uses same encryption method
```

**4. Author's Voice Intrusion**
- Creator personality overrides fiction
- Jokes that break character
- Fix: All content filtered through in-world voice

```
BAD: Puzzle includes pop culture reference character wouldn't know
GOOD: References match character's era, knowledge, personality
```

**5. Metagaming Requirements**
- Success requires player to think as player, not character
- Save-scumming, trial-and-error as intended solution
- Fix: All clues discoverable within fiction

```
BAD: "Try every combination until one works"
GOOD: "The combination is hidden in his last letter"
```

**6. Unmotivated Player Character**
- Why would the protagonist do this?
- Actions lack in-world reason
- Fix: Provide narrative motivation

```
BAD: "Solve puzzles because they're there"
GOOD: "Find these codes to locate my missing sister"
```

**7. Cardboard Characters**
- NPCs exist only to deliver puzzles
- No consistent personality or motivation
- Fix: Develop characters independent of puzzle function

```
BAD: Character only appears to give clues
GOOD: Character has own goals, sometimes helps, sometimes hinders
```

### Mimesis Preservation Strategies

**Puzzle Embedding**
- Every puzzle has in-world reason to exist
- Solution methods match character abilities
- Difficulty explained by in-world factors

**Consistent Characters**
- Characters behave consistently
- Motivations drive actions
- Responses match established personality

**World Coherence**
- Technology matches setting
- Organizations have plausible structure
- Events follow cause and effect

## Player Agency and The Curtain

Balancing scripted narrative with player-driven experience.

### The Agency Spectrum

**Rails**: Fixed path, no deviation
```
Players can only progress one way
Pro: Clean narrative
Con: Feels restrictive, not "real"
```

**Guided**: Main path with optional exploration
```
Core story scripted, side content player-driven
Pro: Balanced experience
Con: Side content may never be found
```

**Sandbox**: Player choices shape story
```
Multiple paths, real consequences
Pro: High engagement, replayability
Con: Complex to design, content may be missed
```

### The Curtain Principle

The "curtain" between puppetmasters (PMs) and players.

**Behind the Curtain** (PMs only):
- Plot outline and planned revelations
- Puzzle solutions and backup solutions
- Character casting and coordination
- Technical infrastructure

**In Front of the Curtain** (player-visible):
- All fictional content
- Character interactions
- Discoverable clues
- Community discussion

**The Curtain's Permeability**:
- Some player actions may influence story
- Community discoveries may accelerate reveals
- Popular theories may be incorporated (carefully)
- Difficulty may be adjusted based on progress

### Player Agency Preservation

**Real Choices**: Player actions have consequences
```
Choose to help character A vs character B
Different information revealed based on choice
```

**Discovery Matters**: Finding things feels earned
```
Players locate trailhead through observation
Not spoon-fed next step
```

**Community Impact**: Collective action changes outcomes
```
100 calls to phone line triggers next phase
Community coordinates effort
```

**Interpretation Space**: Not everything explained
```
Some mysteries remain
Players can theorize
```

## Narrative Architecture

Structuring story revelation across the ARG.

### The Onion Model

Story revealed in layers, each deeper than the last.

```
LAYER 1 (Surface): Initial hook, basic premise
LAYER 2 (Context): World-building, character introduction
LAYER 3 (Conflict): Central mystery, stakes revealed
LAYER 4 (Depth): Backstory, hidden connections
LAYER 5 (Core): Ultimate truth, climactic revelation
```

### Revelation Pacing

**Too Fast**: Players don't feel accomplishment
**Too Slow**: Players lose interest
**Just Right**: Each puzzle advances understanding

```
GOOD PACING:
- Puzzle 1: Confirms there IS a mystery
- Puzzles 2-5: Establish context and stakes
- Puzzles 6-10: Deepen understanding
- Puzzles 11-15: Complicate with new information
- Final puzzles: Climactic revelations
```

### Narrative Anchors

Points that ground players in the story.

**Character Anchors**: People to care about
- Protagonist with relatable motivation
- Antagonist with comprehensible (if not sympathetic) goals
- Supporting characters with distinct personalities

**Emotional Anchors**: Stakes that matter
- Personal danger
- Relationship threats
- World-scale consequences
- Moral dilemmas

**Mystery Anchors**: Questions driving engagement
- Central mystery (what's the truth?)
- Character mysteries (who are they really?)
- Method mysteries (how did X happen?)

## Community Dynamics

How player communities form and function around ARGs.

### Community Roles

**Trailhead Finders**: Discover new content
**Decoders**: Solve ciphers and puzzles
**Archivists**: Document and organize findings
**Theorists**: Synthesize narrative meaning
**Organizers**: Coordinate community action
**Newcomer Guides**: Help new players catch up

### Community Management

**Support Without Spoiling**
- Provide hints, not answers
- Validate effort, not just success
- Encourage collaboration

**Handle Stuck Points**
- Prepare backup clues
- Watch for community frustration
- Don't let momentum die

**Embrace Unexpected Solutions**
- Players may find unintended paths
- Valid solutions should work
- Adapt if necessary

### Community Health

**Positive Dynamics**:
- Collaborative problem-solving
- Sharing discoveries
- Helping newcomers
- Celebrating successes

**Negative Dynamics** (to manage):
- Gatekeeping solutions
- Spoiler sharing without consent
- Harassment (in-game or real)
- Obsessive behavior

## Ethical Considerations

Responsible ARG design.

### Player Welfare

**Consent**: Players should know ARG exists (eventually)
- Soft TINAG allows winks
- Don't manipulate genuinely vulnerable people
- Clear post-game acknowledgment

**Boundaries**: Respect real-world limits
- Don't ask players to trespass
- Don't require unsafe actions
- Don't encourage illegal behavior

**Mental Health**: Watch for concerning behavior
- Obsessive engagement warning signs
- Distinguish fiction from reality
- Provide resources if needed

### Content Considerations

**Real-World Impacts**
- Don't impersonate real organizations deceptively
- Don't spread actual misinformation
- Clear fictional framing (for reasonable observer)

**Sensitive Topics**
- Content warnings where appropriate
- Avoid exploiting real tragedies
- Consider impact on marginalized groups

**Legal Concerns**
- Trademark and copyright
- Defamation risks
- Data collection and privacy

### The Ethics Checklist

Before launching any ARG element:
- [ ] Could this cause real-world harm?
- [ ] Could someone mistake this for reality in a dangerous way?
- [ ] Are we asking players to do anything unethical?
- [ ] Have we considered vulnerable audience members?
- [ ] Is there an exit for players who become uncomfortable?
- [ ] Have we documented our consent and disclosure plan?
