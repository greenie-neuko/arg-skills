## Trailhead Design Principles

### Discoverability Spectrum

**Seeded Discovery** (guided):
- Link shared by official account
- "Leaked" by community manager
- Placed where target audience gathers
- Best for: Controlled launches, specific demographics

**Organic Discovery** (passive):
- Exists, waiting to be found
- Rewards observant fans
- No official acknowledgment
- Best for: Building mystique, rewarding dedication

**Hybrid Approach**:
- Trailhead exists (organic)
- Hint dropped after delay (seeded)
- Community shares discovery (viral)
- Best for: Ensuring discovery while maintaining TINAG

### Trailhead Quality Checklist

**Visibility**:
- [ ] Findable by target audience skill level
- [ ] Not too obvious (breaks immersion)
- [ ] Not too hidden (never found)

**Authenticity**:
- [ ] Fits the fictional world
- [ ] Doesn't break fourth wall
- [ ] Has plausible in-world explanation

**Engagement**:
- [ ] Creates curiosity
- [ ] Provides direction (what to do next)
- [ ] Rewards the finder

**Technical**:
- [ ] Works on all platforms/devices
- [ ] Accessible (not gatekept unfairly)
- [ ] Persistent (won't disappear)

### Trailhead-to-Puzzle Flow

```
TRAILHEAD → Initial curiosity → First discovery
     ↓
CONFIRMATION → "This is real" → Player commitment
     ↓
DIRECTION → "Go here next" → Puzzle engagement
     ↓
COMMUNITY → Shared discovery → Social momentum
```

### Common Trailhead Mistakes

**Too Obvious**:
- "CLICK HERE FOR MYSTERY"
- Breaks TINAG immediately
- No sense of discovery

**Too Obscure**:
- Requires luck to find
- Inside jokes only creators get
- Dependency on specific platform knowledge

**Wrong Audience**:
- Hidden where target players don't go
- Requires skills players don't have
- Cultural/language barriers

**Technically Fragile**:
- Platform could remove content
- Link could break
- Dependent on third-party services

### Platform-Specific Considerations

**YouTube**: Algorithm may suppress cryptic content; use established channel
**Twitter/X**: Character accounts may be suspended; have backup plans
**Discord**: Servers can be reported; moderate carefully
**Reddit**: Posts may be removed; follow subreddit rules
**TikTok**: Content may not surface; hashtag strategy needed
**Pastebin**: Raw URLs are stable; don't rely on search discovery
